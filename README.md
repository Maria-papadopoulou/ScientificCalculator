# ScientificCalculator
A scientific calculator desktop app in Python supporting basic and advanced functions like trig, log, and exponentials. Features a GUI with dark/light mode, keyboard input, real-time results, and easy extensibility. Designed for students and professionals as a practical, user-friendly tool.
# Methodology
In this section, we provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of the methodology followed to design and implement the graphical calculator application. The application was developed using the Python programming language and leverages GUI libraries to offer a user-friendly experience with both basic and scientific calculation functionalities.
# Tools and Libraries Used
The application was developed using Python 3.x For building the graphical user interface, the project uses Tkinter, Python’s standard GUI library. To enhance the appearance and styling of the interface, the project also uses CustomTkinter, an external library that offers modern-themed components and improved customization options. Additionally, the math module is used to perform scientific calculations, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions, as well as constants like π and operations such as square root.
# GUI Framework and Setup
The core of the application is organized within a main class called CalculatorApp, which ensures easier maintenance, and potential reusability of the code. The main window is initialized with a fixed size of 320x460 pixels in standard mode, and it automatically resizes to 400x460 pixels when scientific mode is activated to accommodate extra buttons. Additionally, a theme-switching feature allows users to toggle between light and dark modes for a more personalized and comfortable user experience.
# Layout Design and Widgets
The user interface includes an input area created with a tk.Entry widget, where users can type mathematical expressions. Just below it, a tk.Label widget is used to display the result in real time as the user types. The calculator features various buttons, including standard ones for digits, basic operations, equals, clear, and delete. Additionally, scientific buttons such as sin, cos, tan, log, π, and √ are available and can be toggled on or off using the "Sci" button. A theme toggle button is also included, allowing users to switch between light and dark modes for better visual comfort.
# Functionalities Implemented
The calculator handles expression parsing by converting user input into Python-compatible format. Symbols like ×, ÷, Mod, and ^ are replaced with their Python equivalents (*, /, %, **), while functions such as sin(), cos(), and log() are linked to the corresponding methods from the math module, including automatic conversion from degrees to radians when needed. Constants like π and e are also translated to math.pi and math.e. To enhance user experience, the application supports real-time evaluation of expressions as the user types. This is done using a custom safe_eval function that safely evaluates expressions using only the math module, preventing the execution of unsafe or arbitrary code. Additionally, the calculator includes full keyboard integration, allowing users to enter numbers and operations using their physical keyboard. Keys like digits, operators, Enter, and Backspace are all mapped to their respective button functions in the interface. The application also features a scientific mode toggle. When enabled, scientific function buttons appear on the right side of the window using the .place() method. Disabling the mode hides these buttons using .place_forget() or an equivalent method.
# Results and Discussion
The final result of this project is a fully functional graphical calculator application implemented in Python using the Tkinter and CustomTkinter libraries. The application supports both standard and scientific calculation modes, as well as real-time result previewing and dynamic UI interactions.
# Key Features:
The application offers several useful features to enhance usability and functionality. It performs real-time evaluation, instantly parsing and calculating results as the user types, providing immediate feedback. A scientific mode can be enabled with a button, revealing additional options such as sin, cos, tan, √, log, π, e, and parentheses, enabling more advanced calculations. Users can also switch between light and dark themes for a more comfortable viewing experience. The calculator fully supports keyboard input, allowing efficient interaction with mapped keys for digits, operators, and functions. Finally, all expressions are processed through safe evaluation, using a restricted environment that relies solely on the math module to ensure security and prevent execution of unauthorized code.
